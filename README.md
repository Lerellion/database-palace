# Database Palace üè∞

A modern dashboard for managing and visualizing your (for now, PostgreSQL) database. Works with either a local or remote (neon) instance.

Inspired by Drizzle studio, Prisma studio and Outerbase. Aiming to not only be a table view/editor. But rather offer help and guidance on getting up and running with a Drizzle solution. Offering tools to scaffold server functions/api routes to query or mutate your database from your NextJS application.

## Current Features

- PostgreSQL Support via Neon
- Table Viewer with sorting and pagination
- Schema Visualization
- Basic CRUD Operations
- Responsive Design

## Coming Soon üöÄ

- SQLite support
- Bulk operations for data management
- AI-assisted query generation
- Auto-generate Drizzle/Prisma schemas
- Smart query/mutation generation based on table structure
- AI-powered database operations and optimization
- And more!
